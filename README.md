## Credentials Setup

### Client API Key

Use for: Server management, file operations, backups

1. Log into your Pterodactyl Panel
2. Click your username → **Account Settings**
3. Go to **API Credentials**
4. Click **Create New**
5. Add a description (e.g., "n8n Automation")
6. Copy the key (shown only once!)

### Application API Key

Use for: User management, server creation, admin tasks

1. Log into Pterodactyl as admin
2. Go to **Admin Panel**
3. Navigate to **Application API**
4. Click **Create New**
5. Add description and select permissions
6. Copy the key (shown only once!)

**Tips:**

- Use Client API for most automation tasks
- Only use Application API when you need admin privileges
- Create separate keys for different workflows
- Never share API keys or commit them to code

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Can't connect to Panel**

- Check that your Panel URL is correct (e.g., `https://panel.example.com`)
- Remove any trailing slashes from the URL
- Verify the panel is accessible from your n8n instance

**API Key not working**

- Make sure you copied the entire key
- Check if the key was revoked in the panel
- Verify you're using the right credential type (Client vs Application)

**WebSocket won't connect**

- Ensure Wings is running on the server
- Check firewall rules allow WebSocket connections
- Verify the server ID is correct

**"ConfigurationNotPersistedException" warning**

- This is usually harmless - it means Wings couldn't sync immediately
- The operation succeeded on the Panel
- Wings will sync when it comes back online
